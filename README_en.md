## What is Gameminer.net?

[GameMiner.net](http://gameminer.net/) is a unique and cool place where you can win Steam games for free.

## How do I win? And how can I increase my chances of winning?

By participating in various giveaways. There is no other way of increasing your chances because the winner is picked randomly. But if you choose a giveaway with less people in it, your chances of winning increases.

## How do you get so many games to give away?

People like you and me giveaway some cool stuff here. Yeah, that's right, sharing is cool.

## What is gold and coal? How do I get them?

These are the resources that you need to join giveaways. Coal is free and replenishes hourly. Gold is way cooler, but you have to buy it or earn by creating gold giveaways. Minimum purchase amount - 20 gold.

## What happens to my coal if I get bonus coal from creating a giveaway and it exceeds the maximum amount mentioned in my profie?

You will get all the coal you've earned from your giveaway. Maximum coal is the number you can get per hour for free.

## What's the difference between private, golden and regular giveaways? And what is sandpit?

Common giveaways are cornerstone of GameMiner.net. Most games are being given away through common giveaways. But all the expensive or very neat games are usually given away in gold giveaways. Also, there are less participants, so your chances to win are way higher.  
And we use profits that come from gold giveaways towards site upkeep. Zag-zag.  
In Private giveaway, you can give away everything you want (even your stinky socks), but in private giveaway you won't earn experience or resources.  
The sandpit giveaways are created by new members who have't given away any games or have only given a few approved giveaways. You should enter them with caution, especially if it's an expensive game.

## Is it mandatory to create giveaways? Can't I just join all the giveaways instead of creating them?

You can join all you want, and sharing is always voluntary. But remember: girls like generous dudes.

## What's the deal with levels?

Level is what distinguishes a boy from man. The higher your level is, the more coal you get per hour, invites per day and girls per lifetime. Also you can bump your trade topic more often.
The only way to increase your level is to create more giveaways. That is our way of saying "Thank you" to contributors.
You can find more information about levels [here](http://gameminer.net/forum/1/2069).

## How do I create a giveaway?

Go here: [http://gameminer.net/giveaway/create](http://gameminer.net/giveaway/create)

Choose the game. If the game you're trying to giveaway is not in the list, don’t try to choose it - you will be banned. 

After selecting the game, you can change the distribution of additional parameters, such as price and expiration date. 

There is no time limit for gifts, but it is not recommended to put giveaways for more than couple of months. The maximum giveaway running time for keys is 1 week.

## Can I create giveaway using games from my Steam library?

No you can’t! Once you have activated a game you can't give it to someone else. For giveaways you can only use gifts from your inventory or steam-keys.

## What would I get if I create a giveaway?

You will receive 10% of all gathered coal from common giveaway and 50% of all gathered gold from gold giveaway.
Also you will get some experience based on the price of the game.

## I already own the game; can I still win it?

Sure, be our guest. 

## Can I leave a giveaway?

No.

## A giveaway which I entered was deleted; will I get back my coal/gold?

Yes, you will get back your gold. But no, you will not get back your coal.

## Can I give away the game if I just won it?

Yes, but it’s on your own risk as if the kay is invalid **You** will take all responsibility.

## I won a key but it’s invalid, what should I do?

Well, you have few ways:
* The easiest way - press «Key is invalid» and forget about it.
* You can PM the creator and ask him to change key, if he would.

## Okay, so I won. How do I get my precious game? And what to do if I still didn't receive the gift?

Steam gifts are automaticaly sent via email. Keys are sent via private messages. Don't forget to use your real email.  
If you don’t receive your gift via e-mail, that means that Steam-servers are under heavy load or your e-mail id is wrong. Try to [change your E-mail](http://gameminer.ru/account/mail) and then press «Resend Gift» button on giveaway page.

## What type of games can I contribute?

We accept every type of Steam gifts and keys that are redeemable on Steam. Betas or demos are forbidden. If you would like to contribute non-steam key, you should contact the administration first.

## Tournaments?

## Where can I get crates?

Crate drops are given for playing mini-slots, for creating and entering giveaways. News about it: [http://gameminer.ru/news/78](http://gameminer.ru/news/78) In future there will be a trade function and you will be able to trade for items from your Gameminer-inventory for boxes / keys / paint and other stuff.

## Where can I get a key for my crates?

At this moment your only option is to buy them. Here: [http://gameminer.ru/inventory/keys](http://gameminer.ru/inventory/keys) (1 key = 20 gold)

## How to open crate?

Go to inventory: [http://gameminer.net/account/inventory](http://gameminer.net/account/inventory) Choose key, press «Use». Then choose the crate you like. After opening it you will see your loot from the crate. The crate and key will dissappear after use.

## How do I pass Crate / Stuff to another user?

At this moment, there is no way to do that. But we promise to introduce Trade system by the end of August / mid-September.

## What are the drops from crates? And what are they for?

Gold, Coal, Curse, Blessing, Acid, Nickname Change, Title change, Paint for nickname, Paint for title, Game (Gift or key).
* **Important Documents** - Allows you to change your Nick or your Title.

## Do curses or blessings affect my chance to win?

No, it is just a replacement for the otherwise boring reputation system.

+ Creating fake giveaways
