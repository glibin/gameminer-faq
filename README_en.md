## What is Gameminer.net?

[GameMiner.net](http://gameminer.net/) is a unique and cool place where you can win Steam games absolutely for free.

## How do I win? And how can I increase my chances of winning?

Participate in various giveaways. There is no way to increase your chance because the winner is picked randomly from all the giveaway participants. But if you choose a giveaway with less people in it - your chances increase. 

## How do you get so many games to give away?

Common people like you and me give some cool stuff away here. Yea, that's right, sharing is cool.

## What are gold and coal? How do I get them?

These are resources that you can use to join giveaways. Coal is free and replenishes hourly. Gold is way cooler, but you have to buy it or earn by creating gold giveaways. Minimum purchase amount - 20 gold.

## What happens to my coal if I get bonus coal from creating a giveaway and it exceeds my maximum mentioned in my profie?

You will get all the coal you've earned from your giveaway. Maximum coal is the number you can get per hour for free.

## What's the difference between private, golden and regular giveaways? And what is sandpit?

Common giveaways are cornerstone of GameMiner.net. Most games are being given away through common giveaways. But all the expensive or very neat games are usually given away in gold giveaways. Also, there are much less participants, so your chances to win are way higher.  
We use profits that come from gold giveaways towards site upkeep. Zag-zag.  
In Private giveaway you can give away everything you want (even your stinky socks), but for private give away you won't get experience or any resource.  
The sandpit giveaways are created by new members who doesn't have or have just a few approved key giveaways. You should enter them with caution, especially if it's expensive game..

## Is it mandatory to create giveaways? Can I just join all the giveaways instead of creating them?

You can join all you want, and sharing is always voluntary. But remember: girls like generous dudes.

## What's the deal with levels?

Level is what distinguishes boy from man. The higher your level is, the more coal you get per hour, invites per day, girls per lifetime. Also you can bump your trade topic more often.
The only way to increase your level is to create giveaways. That is our way in saying "thank you" to contributors.
All info about levels you can find [here](http://gameminer.net/forum/1/2069).
